I whipped up this template for the Hanko Hackathon 2023. Dive into the details and see what I crafted over at [my blog](https://johanguse.dev/blog/hanko-auth-hackathon)

https://github.com/johanguse/nextjs14-hanko-auth/assets/6184866/ef3423e1-9c7d-4759-a0dc-0e5acf4960b4

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First things first, if you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johanguse/nextjs14-hanko-auth.git
cd nextjs14-hanko-auth
```
With everything in place, kickstart your development journey with these simple steps:


1. **Setup Environment Variables**: Before you can run the project, make sure to add the necessary Hanko API URL to your `.env` file. You can obtain this URL by logging into your Hanko account and navigating to the main dashboard. If you're deploying on Vercel, remember to set this variable there as well.

2. **Install Dependencies**: If you've cloned the repository, ensure all dependencies are installed. Depending on your package manager preference:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or 
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
    or 
    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

Now, open up your browser and head to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your project come to life. 

Enjoy tinkering and happy coding! üéâüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
